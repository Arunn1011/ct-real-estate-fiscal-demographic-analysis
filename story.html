  <h1>The Price of Place: Housing, Taxes, and Demographics in Connecticut</h1>

<section style="padding-top: 2rem;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Over the past two decades, Connecticut’s housing market has changed dramatically — with sharp ups and downs in prices, uneven recovery from the 2008 crisis, and a surge in values after COVID-19. But behind the numbers lies a deeper story of inequality, shaped by real estate trends, municipal finances, and population shifts. Housing prices have soared in recent years, especially in towns like Greenwich, Westport, and Darien. But this isn’t just about strong demand. The state has built far fewer new homes since 2012 than it did in the early 2000s, limiting supply and pushing prices higher. This makes it harder for families to find affordable homes, especially in growing towns (<a href="https://www.ctinsider.com/waterbury/opinion/article/affordable-housing-regulations-developments-20290478.php" target="_blank">CT Insider</a>). At the same time, many areas have not fully bounced back from the 2008 financial crisis. As of early 2023, Connecticut had one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country — about 1 in every 2,700 homes. Programs like MyHomeCT were launched to help, but long-term stress continues to affect many homeowners (<a href="https://ctmirror.org/2023/04/21/ct-foreclosure-help-prevention-programs-myhomect/" target="_blank">CT Mirror</a>).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Towns with more wealth benefit from high home values and broad tax bases, which allow them to charge low property tax rates while still covering local services. In contrast, cities like Hartford face the opposite problem. Much of their property — like hospitals and government buildings — is tax-exempt, meaning the burden falls on a small group of residents and businesses. Hartford has one of the highest property tax rates in the state because it has fewer valuable properties to tax (<a href="https://ctmirror.org/2016/08/31/will-hartfords-crisis-force-a-ct-property-tax-overhaul/" target="_blank">CT Mirror</a>). This system makes it hard for some towns to grow, while others benefit from past investments and stronger tax bases. Connecticut’s tax structure itself adds to the imbalance. A 2024 report found that the poorest families in the state pay a much larger share of their income in taxes than the wealthiest do. This includes property taxes, which are based on what someone owns — not what they earn. So even if a homeowner has a low income, they might still face high taxes if they live in a town with high mill rates and low property values (<a href="https://ctmirror.org/2024/01/16/ct-income-property-tax-fairness-itep/" target="_blank">CT Mirror, 2024</a>). Local leaders also warn that state budget plans could make things worse by keeping funding flat, forcing resource-limited towns to raise taxes just to fund schools and services (<a href="https://www.ctinsider.com/politics/article/connecticut-towns-cities-lamont-property-taxes-20225564.php" target="_blank">CT Insider, 2024</a>).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Alongside these financial challenges, the state’s population is also changing. Most Connecticut towns are small, with fewer than 50,000 people. But a bigger trend is the aging of the population. Nearly 25% of residents are over 60, and that number is growing (<a href="https://www.ctinsider.com/connecticut/article/ct-aging-population-grows-in-ct-health-issues-20304535.php" target="_blank">CT Insider, 2023</a>). Older adults tend to need more medical care and support services, and as the number of younger workers declines, fewer people are available to support those needs through taxes and labor. In some towns, the dependency ratio — the number of dependents per 100 working-age adults — is over 90%, creating even more pressure on local budgets and healthcare systems.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Together, these trends show that where someone lives in Connecticut can shape nearly every part of their financial reality. Wealthy towns with high home values and low taxes offer stability and growth. Others face high taxes, low incomes, and shrinking or aging populations — all of which make it harder to fund services or attract new investment. To make housing and local taxes fairer across the state, policymakers will need to look at the full picture: how home prices, income, tax structures, and population shifts all interact.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    These patterns are further reinforced by the long-term behavior of Connecticut’s real estate market. Between 2001 and 2022, housing prices across the state followed national trends — stagnating after the 2008 crash and surging after 2020 due to pandemic-related demand, remote work, and low interest rates. However, towns experienced these trends differently. Affluent areas like Greenwich and Westport saw home values soar while maintaining low mill rates, making them highly desirable but increasingly inaccessible. Cities like Hartford and Waterbury, by contrast, faced stagnant property values and some of the highest tax rates, limiting their ability to attract new residents or development. This paradox — that wealthier towns pay lower effective taxes — highlights how real estate strength and fiscal policy are tightly linked, reinforcing inequality. Meanwhile, aging towns with high dependency ratios and weaker housing markets struggle to maintain services, putting additional pressure on already vulnerable populations. Ultimately, the housing market in Connecticut cannot be separated from municipal finance or demographic change. Affordability depends not just on sale prices, but on the intersection of income, taxation, and who bears the cost of maintaining communities.
