  <h2>Unexpected Patterns: When Do Homes Actually Sell?</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    It turns out that Connecticut real estate has a favorite day of the week: Monday. Between 2001 and 2022, more homes were sold at the start of the week than on any other day. The reason? While Saturdays may be for open houses and Sundays for browsing listings, actual closings wait for weekdays when banks, attorneys, and municipal offices are open. Monday often becomes the first and most convenient opportunity to finalize transactions after the weekend’s paperwork. It’s a subtle reminder that even in real estate, timing is everything — and apparently, Monday is prime time.

  <h2>Seasonal Surges: When Do People Actually Move?</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Summer isn’t just for vacations — it’s also peak moving season in Connecticut. Between 2001 and 2022, the housing market came alive in June, July, and August, with each month recording close to 70,000 sales. Warm weather, the end of the school year, and longer daylight hours create the perfect window for house hunting, inspections, and relocations. In contrast, the frigid early months of January and February saw the fewest closings. It appears that even buyers agree — winter is for staying in, not moving out.

  <h2>Connecticut’s Gender Imbalance: Where the Scales Tip</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Who runs the town? It depends where you go. In some corners of Connecticut, gender balance skews dramatically. In Somers, for instance, there are roughly 150 men for every 100 women — a strikingly male-heavy ratio, largely due to the presence of correctional facilities. On the other hand, towns like Canaan and Bloomfield lean in the opposite direction, with significantly more women than men. These imbalances reveal how institutional, demographic, and economic factors shape the social fabric of different communities. Whether it’s driven by employment patterns, retirement trends, or large single-gender institutions, the gender divide gives each town a unique demographic fingerprint.
