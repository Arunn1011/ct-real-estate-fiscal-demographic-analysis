    <h2>1. Dataset Description</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset, maintained by the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management, contains all recorded real estate sales valued at $2,000 or more from fiscal years 2001 through 2022. Each record corresponds to a property transaction reported between October 1 and September 30 of a given fiscal year and includes key attributes such as the sale date, property address, town, property type, sale amount, and assessed value. The dataset spans residential, commercial, industrial, apartment, and vacant land transactions, offering a comprehensive view of the real estate landscape across Connecticut municipalities.

    <h2>2. Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        Understanding long-term real estate trends is essential for analyzing economic cycles, housing affordability, and patterns of urban development. Given real estate's critical role in household wealth, municipal revenue, and community growth, this analysis investigates how property values and transaction activity have evolved across Connecticut’s towns over the past two decades. The primary objectives are to identify long-term price trends, detect regional disparities, and understand the impact of major market events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis also explores the relationship between sales prices and assessed values to evaluate valuation consistency and equity.

    <h2>3. Data Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>
        Initial preprocessing focused on ensuring completeness and consistency of key fields. Records with missing values in essential columns such as "Property Type," "Date Recorded," and "Address" were removed to avoid unreliable aggregations. The "Date Recorded" column was converted into standardized datetime format to enable accurate time-series grouping. Town names were cleaned using title casing and whitespace trimming to ensure alignment with geographic shapefiles used in mapping. Duplicate or incomplete entries were implicitly removed through filtering operations. These steps produced a clean, structured dataset suitable for temporal and spatial analysis.
