  <h1>Real Estate Sales Trends in Connecticut (2001–2022)</h1>

  <section>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Over the past two decades, Connecticut's real estate landscape has evolved through economic booms, financial downturns, and demographic shifts. Using official sales records maintained by the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management, this analysis explores how residential and commercial property markets have transformed from 2001 through 2022. The dataset includes every property transaction valued at $2,000 or more, covering property types from single-family homes to industrial land across all towns in the state. With over two million records, the data offers insight into long-term price trends, regional disparities, and the evolving character of Connecticut's built environment.

    <h3>How have property prices changed over time?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      A longitudinal view of median sales prices reveals sharp cycles tied to national and global events. Prices steadily increased through the early 2000s, peaking just before the 2008 housing crisis. A significant decline followed, with prices stabilizing for much of the 2010s. The pandemic years, however, marked a resurgence—fueled by record-low interest rates and migration trends—which pushed prices beyond their pre-crisis highs. This recovery reflects shifting demand patterns and broader market restructuring.

    <h3>How are property values distributed across types?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Different property types exhibit distinct pricing behaviors. Residential and apartment units tend to cluster around mid-range values, while commercial, industrial, and vacant land transactions show wide variability. The distribution of sale prices, shown on a log scale, underscores the heterogeneity in Connecticut’s property market and the presence of high-value outliers, particularly in commercial real estate.

  <section>
    <h3>Which property types dominate the market?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      While high-value properties attract attention, the overwhelming majority of Connecticut's real estate activity occurs in the residential sector. Single-family and general residential transactions account for more than three-quarters of recorded sales. This dominance emphasizes the relevance of housing-focused policy discussions and reflects the state’s primarily suburban and small-town character.

  <section>
    <h3>How do prices vary across towns?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      A spatial view of median sale prices reveals stark regional contrasts. Towns in coastal Fairfield County—such as Greenwich, Westport, and Darien—consistently report the highest property values. In contrast, rural and post-industrial towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state remain more affordable. These geographic trends illustrate the influence of proximity to New York City, school district ratings, and access to transportation corridors.

  <section>
    <h3>Do sale prices reflect assessed property values?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Comparing actual sale prices to municipal assessments provides insight into valuation accuracy and equity. The ratio of sale to assessed value varies widely across towns, with some areas regularly selling well above assessments and others below. These discrepancies may indicate outdated revaluation schedules or localized market pressures and could have implications for municipal tax fairness.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Connecticut's real estate data from 2001–2022 captures a dynamic narrative of recovery, growth, and disparity. Prices have rebounded past historic highs, the market remains deeply residential in character, and geographic differences persist. These insights not only inform local and state-level planning but also contribute to a broader understanding of how Connecticut’s communities are evolving in response to economic forces, policy, and social change.
