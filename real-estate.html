    <h2>1. Dataset Description</h2>
    <p>
      The dataset, maintained by the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management, contains all recorded real estate sales valued at $2,000 or more from fiscal years 2001 through 2022. Each record corresponds to a property transaction reported between October 1 and September 30 of a given fiscal year and includes key attributes such as the sale date, property address, town, property type, sale amount, and assessed value. The dataset spans residential, commercial, industrial, apartment, and vacant land transactions, offering a comprehensive view of the real estate landscape across Connecticut municipalities.

    <h2>2. Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding long-term real estate trends is essential for analyzing economic cycles, housing affordability, and patterns of urban development. Given real estate's critical role in household wealth, municipal revenue, and community growth, this analysis investigates how property values and transaction activity have evolved across Connecticut’s towns over the past two decades. The primary objectives are to identify long-term price trends, detect regional disparities, and understand the impact of major market events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis also explores the relationship between sales prices and assessed values to evaluate valuation consistency and equity.

    <h2>3. Data Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>
      Initial preprocessing focused on ensuring completeness and consistency of key fields. Records with missing values in essential columns such as "Property Type," "Date Recorded," and "Address" were removed to avoid unreliable aggregations. The "Date Recorded" column was converted into standardized datetime format to enable accurate time-series grouping. Town names were cleaned using title casing and whitespace trimming to ensure alignment with geographic shapefiles used in mapping. Duplicate or incomplete entries were implicitly removed through filtering operations. These steps produced a clean, structured dataset suitable for temporal and spatial analysis.

  <h2>4. Analysis</h2>

  <h3>How have real estate prices evolved over the past two decades?</h3>
  <p>
    The Connecticut real estate market has undergone significant structural and cyclical shifts between 2001 and 2022. A longitudinal view of median property prices reveals a clear upward trajectory until 2007, followed by a pronounced decline during the financial crisis. Prices remained relatively stagnant for several years before entering a period of rapid growth beginning around 2020. This post-pandemic rise is likely associated with increased housing demand, low interest rates, and migration away from dense urban centers. The price recovery not only restored pre-crisis levels but exceeded them, signaling a broader transformation in regional housing dynamics.

  <h3>What is the distribution of sale prices across property types?</h3>
  <p>
    When comparing sale prices by property type, residential and apartment units display the most concentrated price distributions, with moderate medians and relatively tight interquartile ranges. In contrast, commercial and industrial transactions exhibit broader dispersion and higher price ceilings, indicating greater volatility and value diversity within those categories. A log-scaled boxplot helps uncover hidden outliers and skewed distributions that would otherwise be obscured in linear plots.

  <h3>Which property types dominate Connecticut’s real estate market?</h3>
  <p>
    The volume of transactions further reinforces the residential sector’s central role in the state's property market. Horizontal bar plots of property type frequency show that residential properties constitute the overwhelming majority of transactions, far outpacing commercial, vacant land, and other categories. This imbalance underscores the relevance of focusing on housing trends as the core of statewide real estate analysis.

  <h3>Where are property values highest and lowest across the state?</h3>
  <p>
    Spatial disparities in property value are also apparent at the municipal level. A choropleth map of median sale prices by town highlights significant regional variation, with coastal and metropolitan-adjacent towns like Greenwich, Westport, and Darien displaying markedly higher median prices compared to more rural or inland communities. These differences reflect not only market demand but also broader socio-economic stratification across the state.

  </div>

  <h3>Are sale prices aligned with municipal assessed values?</h3>
  <p>
    To assess the fairness and consistency of valuations, we compare sale prices with assessed values using the sale-to-assessment ratio. A second spatial visualization shows that certain towns consistently sell above or below their assessed values, suggesting disparities in municipal valuation practices. These findings may have implications for property taxation policy and perceptions of equity among property owners.

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This analysis highlights clear market cycles, regional disparities, and valuation inconsistencies across Connecticut's real estate landscape. These insights form a foundational layer for understanding local fiscal health and anticipating demographic shifts, and they will be integrated into the final combined synthesis across datasets.
