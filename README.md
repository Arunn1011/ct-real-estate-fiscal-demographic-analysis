## Project Overview

This project investigates how real estate trends, municipal fiscal conditions, and demographic shifts have interacted across Connecticut’s 169 towns from 2001 to 2040. By analyzing publicly available datasets on property transactions, local tax structures, and population projections, we explore how location influences home values, affordability, and long-term community sustainability.

Our goal is to identify spatial and temporal patterns that contribute to structural inequality, fiscal imbalance, and demographic pressure across different types of municipalities. The findings are presented as an interactive web-based data story that combines visualization, mapping, and narrative analysis.
