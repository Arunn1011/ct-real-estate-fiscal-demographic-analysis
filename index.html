  <h1>Connecticut Real Estate, Fiscal & Demographic Analysis</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    A comprehensive exploration of how housing prices, municipal finances, and population trends have evolved across Connecticut's towns over the past two decades.
  </p>
  <section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      This project explores how housing prices, municipal tax systems, and population dynamics intersect to shape life across Connecticut's 169 towns. Using three publicly available datasets — real estate sales from 2001 to 2022, municipal fiscal indicators from 2019 to 2024, and population projections through 2040 — we analyze two decades of change in home values, local tax burdens, and community demographics. By combining these perspectives, we uncover patterns of inequality, identify which towns are thriving or struggling, and highlight the hidden forces driving affordability, investment, and fiscal stress. The goal is to tell a unified, data-driven story of how place determines opportunity — and to provide insights that support more equitable planning, taxation, and housing policies across the state.

    <h2>Datasets and Sources</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Real Estate Sales (2001–2018):</strong>
        <span style="text-align: justify; display: block;">
          This dataset includes every recorded property sale in Connecticut from 2001 to 2018 where the sale price was $2,000 or more. It covers all property types — from single-family homes and condos to commercial buildings and vacant land — and includes details such as sale price, date, town, and property type.

      <li>
        <strong>Municipal Fiscal Indicators (2019–2024):</strong>
        <span style="text-align: justify; display: block;">
          This dataset from the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management provides a yearly snapshot of municipal finances across all 169 towns in the state, covering the years 2019 to 2024. It includes key figures like population estimates, mill rates (property tax rates), and the grand list, which reflects the total taxable value of property in each town.

      <li>
        <strong>Town Population Projections (2015–2040):</strong>
        <span style="text-align: justify; display: block;">
          This dataset shows population projections for every town in Connecticut from 2015 through 2040. It includes estimates broken down by age group and year, giving a sense of how each town’s population is expected to grow, shrink, or age over time. The projections were created by the Connecticut State Data Center using current trends in births, deaths, and migration.
