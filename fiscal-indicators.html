  <h1>Fiscal Landscape and Taxation Patterns in Connecticut (2019–2024)</h1>

  <!-- Grand List Growth -->
  <section style="padding-top: 2rem;">
    <h3>Trends in Municipal Wealth: Grand List Growth</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      When you follow the Grand List — the total value of all taxable property in a town — you gain a clear sense of how Connecticut’s municipalities are evolving. It reflects local development, investment, and economic strength. In this chart, we examine four towns: Stamford, Hartford, Danbury, and Fairfield. Stamford leads with the highest property value, increasing every year even through the pandemic. A key factor is major development investment — notably a $450 million hospital expansion in 2016 that purchased around 40 neighboring properties and expanded the campus from 20 to 30 acres. Danbury shows steady growth. From 2019 to 2022, its Grand List rose gradually, supported by a competitive housing market where limited inventory led to quick sales and rising home values. Fairfield’s property value remained relatively flat during this period, suggesting stability without significant expansion. Meanwhile, Hartford — starting from the lowest base — showed a slow but steady recovery after an earlier decline. These fiscal trends highlight how economic development, housing demand, and local investment drive changes in a town’s taxable wealth.

  <!-- Population vs Grand List -->
  <section style="padding-top: 2rem;">
    <h3>Does Population Growth Translate into Wealth Expansion?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Not all growth is created equal. In Connecticut, some towns are gaining population, others are building wealth—and only a few are doing both. This scatter plot visualizes every town based on two key year-over-year changes: population on the X-axis and Grand List property value on the Y-axis. Each dot represents a town; dots higher on the chart reflect increasing wealth, while those further right reflect population growth. Towns like Shelton and Glastonbury are succeeding on both fronts—attracting new residents while increasing property value. Others, like Branford, are gaining wealth but losing people, suggesting rising home values but declining community size. In contrast, some towns in the bottom right are growing in population but not in wealth, while those in the bottom left are losing both. This visualization highlights divergence across the state, showing which communities are thriving, which are stagnating, and which may be falling behind.

  <!-- Highest Mill Rates -->
  <section style="padding-top: 2rem;">
    <h3>Where Are Property Tax Rates Highest?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Mill rates determine the property tax paid per $1,000 of assessed value and vary widely across towns. Towns with the highest mill rates in 2022 are largely concentrated in Connecticut’s urban and fiscally constrained areas. Hartford tops the list, followed closely by Waterbury, Hamden, and New Britain — all municipalities with aging infrastructure, dense populations, and greater reliance on public services. These towns often lack a sufficiently broad tax base, pushing them to raise mill rates to fund operations, schools, and essential services. High mill rates can signal financial stress and may deter new development or investment, creating a cycle that’s difficult to break.

  <!-- Lowest Mill Rates -->
  <section style="padding-top: 2rem;">
    <h3>Towns with the Lowest Property Tax Burdens</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      In contrast, towns with the lowest mill rates — including Salisbury, Greenwich, and Westport — tend to be affluent, low-density communities with high-value real estate. These towns enjoy large grand lists, allowing them to generate sufficient revenue with minimal taxation. Their financial strength means they can maintain services without imposing high tax burdens on residents. Lower mill rates often make these towns more attractive to homeowners and investors, reinforcing their wealth advantage over time.
