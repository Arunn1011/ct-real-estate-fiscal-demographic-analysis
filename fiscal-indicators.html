  <h1>Fiscal Landscape and Taxation Patterns in Connecticut (2019–2024)</h1>

    <h2>Understanding the Fiscal Pulse of Connecticut</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Property taxes are the financial lifeblood of Connecticut’s municipalities. From funding local schools and infrastructure to determining homeowner burdens, the fiscal health of a town is tightly linked to two key indicators: the size of its tax base (measured by the Grand List) and its mill rate (the property tax rate per $1,000 of assessed value). This section dives into the dynamic interplay between municipal wealth, taxation patterns, and demographic change. By examining town-level trends in property value growth, population shifts, and tax burden disparities between 2019 and 2024, we aim to reveal how different communities are evolving — fiscally, socially, and economically.

  <!-- Grand List Growth -->
  <section style="padding-top: 2rem;">
    <h3>Trends in Municipal Wealth: Grand List Growth</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      When you follow the Grand List — the total value of all taxable property in a town — you gain a clear sense of how Connecticut’s municipalities are evolving. It reflects local development, investment, and economic strength. In this chart, we examine four towns: Stamford, Hartford, Danbury, and Fairfield. These four towns were selected to represent a diverse cross-section of Connecticut’s economic and geographic landscape. Stamford illustrates sustained high-value growth driven by major commercial and healthcare investments. Hartford, the state capital, offers a contrasting picture of fiscal recovery from a lower tax base, highlighting urban financial challenges. Danbury reflects a mid-sized, fast-growing housing market with steady gains, while Fairfield represents a relatively stable suburban community with consistent but modest property value trends. Together, they capture a range of development trajectories and municipal wealth profiles across the state. Stamford leads with the highest property value, increasing every year even through the pandemic. A key factor is major development investment — notably a $450 million hospital expansion in 2016 that purchased around 40 neighboring properties and expanded the campus from 20 to 30 acres. Danbury shows steady growth. From 2019 to 2022, its Grand List rose gradually, supported by a competitive housing market where limited inventory led to quick sales and rising home values. Fairfield’s property value remained relatively flat during this period, suggesting stability without significant expansion. Meanwhile, Hartford — starting from the lowest base — showed a slow but steady recovery after an earlier decline. These fiscal trends highlight how economic development, housing demand, and local investment drive changes in a town’s taxable wealth.

  <!-- Population vs Grand List -->
  <section style="padding-top: 2rem;">
    <h3>Does Population Growth Translate into Wealth Expansion?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Not all growth is created equal. In Connecticut, some towns are gaining population, others are building wealth—and only a few are doing both. The scatter plot comparing year-over-year changes in population and Grand List property value reveals clear divergence among Connecticut towns. Towns like Mansfield and New Haven appear in the top-right quadrant, showing simultaneous growth in both population and taxable wealth—an indicator of balanced and sustainable development. In contrast, Greenwich and Stamford, while experiencing strong gains in property value, fall into the top-left quadrant, reflecting economic strength despite declining population. Some towns in the bottom-right quadrant are gaining residents but not seeing equivalent wealth growth, while those in the bottom-left are declining on both fronts. This pattern underscores the uneven nature of municipal growth in the state and highlights where targeted policy attention may be most needed.

  <!-- Highest Mill Rates -->
  <section style="padding-top: 2rem;">
    <h3>Where Are Property Tax Rates Highest?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Mill rates determine the property tax paid per $1,000 of assessed value and vary widely across towns. Towns with the highest mill rates in 2022 are largely concentrated in Connecticut’s urban and fiscally constrained areas. Hartford tops the list, followed closely by Waterbury, Hamden, and New Britain — all municipalities with aging infrastructure, dense populations, and greater reliance on public services. These towns often lack a sufficiently broad tax base, pushing them to raise mill rates to fund operations, schools, and essential services. High mill rates can signal financial stress and may deter new development or investment, creating a cycle that’s difficult to break.

  </section>

  <!-- Lowest Mill Rates -->
  <section style="padding-top: 2rem;">
    <h3>Towns with the Lowest Property Tax Burdens</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      In contrast, towns with the lowest mill rates — including Salisbury, Greenwich, and Westport — tend to be affluent, low-density communities with high-value real estate. These towns enjoy large grand lists, allowing them to generate sufficient revenue with minimal taxation. Their financial strength means they can maintain services without imposing high tax burdens on residents. Lower mill rates often make these towns more attractive to homeowners and investors, reinforcing their wealth advantage over time.

    <h2>Key Takeaways from Connecticut’s Fiscal Landscape</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This analysis of Connecticut’s municipal finance landscape reveals pronounced disparities in how towns generate and manage revenue. Urban centers such as Hartford and Waterbury maintain some of the highest mill rates in the state, reflecting the fiscal strain of delivering essential services with limited tax bases. In contrast, affluent towns like Greenwich and Salisbury can sustain low tax burdens thanks to expansive, high-value property portfolios. Crucially, population growth and property value growth do not always move in tandem. Some towns are adding residents without comparable gains in taxable wealth, while others are growing wealthier despite population decline. This decoupling highlights the complexity of fiscal health and the challenges of long-term sustainability for both growing and shrinking municipalities. These fiscal trends are not just numbers—they underpin the capacity of towns to fund schools, maintain infrastructure, and provide public services. As such, this fiscal layer offers essential context in our broader investigation into how population dynamics, housing markets, and public finance shape opportunity and inequality across Connecticut.
